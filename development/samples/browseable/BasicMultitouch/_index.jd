<p>This samples demonstrates how to use the {@link android.view.MotionEvent}
API to keep track of individual touches across multiple touch events.</p>
<p>To see this in action, run the sample and touch the screen with multiple
fingers to show that the pointer id (also represented by a colour) does not
change as new touch events are received.</p>
