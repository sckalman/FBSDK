<p>This sample demonstrates a user interface design pattern for simple data
entry from an {@link android.app.ActionBar}. The sample implements a custom
<strong>Done/Cancel</strong> bar to provide users with an easy way to directly
save or cancel their changes. This design pattern is suitable for scenarios
where no additional view details or actions are needed in the action bar.</p>
