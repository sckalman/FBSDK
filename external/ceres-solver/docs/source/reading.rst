For a short but informative introduction to the subject we recommend
the booklet by [Madsen]_ . For a general introduction to non-linear
optimization we recommend [NocedalWright]_. [Bjorck]_ remains the
seminal reference on least squares problems. [TrefethenBau]_ book is
our favorite text on introductory numerical linear algebra. [Triggs]_
provides a thorough coverage of the bundle adjustment problem.
